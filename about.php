                    <p class="py-5">A web- based application for performing the Benedict test ( Benedictâ€™s test is utilized to test for carbohydrates and non-reducing or reducing sugar and its answer can be utilized to test for the presence of glucose in urine). Since, in the lockdown conditions schools and colleges are closed, doing experiment in the physical labs is not possible these days. As a teacher demonstrating experiment to the students via online mode becomes difficult as well as for the students to learn.
                    So, our virtual lab simulates an environment to conduct expermients for students.</p>
